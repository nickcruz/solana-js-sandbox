# Solana JS Sandbox

Test environment to test various Solana functions.

Most of the environments here will be "learning tests" or tests that are quick runtime environments to aid the development of other libraries such as [SolanaKT](https://github.com/nickcruz/SolanaKT).

## Running the test environment

Install dependencies

```
yarn
```

Run all tests

```
yarn start
```
